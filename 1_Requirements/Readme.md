**Introduction:**

Basic project which can be used to calculate athematic calculation from given numbers and shows the output.

**Research**** :**

A calculator is a device that performs athematic operations on numbers. The simple calculator can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.

**4w&#39;s&amp;1H:**

**Who** :

- Calculators used students, shop owners, Cammon people etc.

**What:**

- It is electronic devices process of calculate mathematical operations solutions.

**When:**

- The project is Solving mathematical operation easy to find the value.

**Where:**

- Schools, College, Shops, Banks, financial sector etc.

**How:**

- User enter the numbers take the input to calculator after click on required operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc like different operations) choose they required operation. Display the required solving result in display in calculator.

**SWOT Analysis:**

**Strengths:**

- Timely access
- Increased efficiency
- Reduces Manual work
- Increase accuracy

**Weakness**** :**

- Overtakes time human work
- Expensive

**Opportunities:**

- Less time solve problem
- Easy to operated

**Threats:**

- Not solve higher level operations in mathematics.
